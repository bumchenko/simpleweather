# simpleweather



This project has a poor front-end side, but i've tried some new technologies for myself.

Requirements: Node.JS, axios, cors, dotenv, express, request

Installation: 
  npm i axios cors dotenv express request
  
  
  
Change the api key in .env file, you can get your own on openweathermap.org
